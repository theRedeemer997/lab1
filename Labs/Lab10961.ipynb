And then in challenge 4, I created a  2D array [[10,20,45], [30,12,16], [42,17,56]] and sliced the 2D array to get the first two rows, slice the 2D array to get the last two rows.And then I created a two 2 X 2 arrays and demonstrated how I can stack the elements horizontally vertically and split the arrays to smaller arrays. And then I created two  matrices X= ([[5, 7, 2], [4, 5, 6], [7, 4 ,2]]) Y= ([[4, 2], [6, 2], [4, 2]]) and I multiplied them and also demonstrated the case when the multiplication of matrices are not possible. And then according to the next challenge I created two arrays  x = ([2, -1, -8]) y = ([3, 1, -2]), found the Shape, Number of dimensions of vector x. Reshaped the vector x to a matrix of size (3,1) and determine the number of dimensions after reshaping y to a matrix of (3,1).

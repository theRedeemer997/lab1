**Lab 2**

**This lab provides insight into the concept of probability and statistical measures that you could use to classify the data as spam or not spam 
and also clean the data by removing the outliers using measures of central tendency and dispersion.
The datasets have been enclosed**.

**Part A:**

Use the **Lab2 dataset** provided. Load the dataset and split it into test and train. After that, train the model using Gaussian and Multinominal 
classifiers and post which model performs better. Use the trained model to perform some predictions on test data.

**Part B:**

Use this **air bnb new york city dataset** and remove outliers based on price per night for a given apartment/home. 
You can demonstrate why using other techniques like mean/median/ percentile works. 
The task is to come up with a clean dataset that does not have outliers showcasing all the possibilities.

**Notes:**

This lab should be submitted as a notebook and an HTML. Follow https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart.

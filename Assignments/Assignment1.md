**CSCN8000 Artificial Intelligence Algorithms and Mathematics**

1.	Given the symptoms exhibited in a patient and a database of anonymized patient records, predict whether the patient is likely to have an illness (Parkinson’s disease).
    A model of this decision problem could be used by a program to provide decision support to medical professionals.
  	
   You can follow the following steps :
  	
   •	Data Analysis
  	
   •	Data Preprocessing
  	
   •	Data Standardization
  	
   •	Model Training
  	
   •	Measure your model’s accuracy.
  	
      a.	Use 80% of samples as training data size.

   •	Build a predictive system to verify that the model built is able to predict the patient’s Parkinson’s disease with one instance of the dataset.

**Assignment 2 CSCN8000 Artificial Intelligence Algorithms and Mathematics**

Download heart disease dataset heart.csv in Resources folder and do following,  https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

1.Consider the heart disease dataset in pandas dataframe
2.Remove outliers using mean,median,Z score. 
3.Convert text columns to numbers using label encoding and one hot encoding
4.Apply scaling
5.Build a machine learning classification model using support vector machine. 
  Demonstrate the standalone model as well as Bagging model and include observations about the oerformance
6.Now use decision tree classifier. Use standalone model as well as Bagging and check if you notice any difference in performance
7.Comparing performance of svm and decision tree classifier figure out where it makes most sense to use bagging and why.
